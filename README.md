To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by performing operations like adding, viewing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

⭐Purpose / Motivation

I developed this application to:

• Strengthen my DSA concepts by implementing real-world functionalities.

• Improve my application development skills by building a functional console-based tool.

• Practice using data structures like linked lists or arrays for task management.

⭐Features:

• Add Tasks – Users can add new tasks to the list.

• View Tasks – Users can view all tasks, including pending and completed ones.

• Delete Tasks – Remove tasks from the list once they are no longer needed.

• Mark as Completed – Mark tasks as done, so they are easy to track.
